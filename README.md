#### Commit style ####
Template:

**type(scope): subject**

Type is one of the following:

Type  | Meaning
------------- | -------------
feat  | a new feature
fix  | a bugfix
docs  | documentation change (including comments)
style  | minor cleanup/code style enforcement
refactor  | larger changes, refactoring of code or structure
test  | added tests
asset | added an asset of some kind (textures, audio etc)

Scope is the 'where' of the commit. This can be a specific class, or some abstract structure (like commands), or misc if it's all over the place.
Subject is a short message about what was done.

**Examples:**

feat(entities.components): added camera handling 

fix(selectioncommand): fixed zero-size selections (issue #56)

refactor(units): units are now entities, holding entities.components which do things
